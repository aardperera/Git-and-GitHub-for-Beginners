## What is Git?

**Git** is an example of a _distributed version Control System_ which is commenly used for open source and commercial software development. 

First let's see what is a **version control system** and why we need it.  <br>
<p align="justify"> 
It just tracks and manages all the changes and modifications to source code over time. It is a software tool that helps to software development teams to work faster and smarter with the confidence that any version can be recoverd at any time. Developers can review project history to find out which changes were made who made the changes, when were the changes made, why were changes needed. Without a version control system, for a single developer, it's already a challenge to keep track of multiple copies of a single project. Now imagine developers collaborate as teams, the situation becomes worse. Therefore, using a version control system is a best practice for high performing software development teams.
